Just wanted to say, that the project is not dead. It's frozen due to the fact
that the latest Go weekly got rid of makefiles. I'm working on replacement for
that in a form of Go support for the waf build system. Should take less than a
month and then I'll continue gogobject.

GObject-introspection based bindings generator for Go. Work in progress.

See 'documentation' dir for details.


Try building a set of bindings for gtk+-2.0 using all-2.0.bash script or for
gtk+-3.0 using all-3.0.bash script.


GObject-introspection is a new project, therefore it requires the set of fairly
recent both libraries and tools, here's the list of versions on my machine:

gobject-introspection    1.30.0
atk                      2.2.0
cairo                    1.10.2
gdk2/gtk2                2.24.8
gdk3/gtk3                3.2.3
gdk-pixbuf2              2.24.1
glib2                    2.30.2
gtksourceview3           3.2.3
pango                    1.29.4


Here's the short TODO list:
 - Implement unions (GdkEvent is the main user)
 - Implement the rest of gogtk-demo.
 - Implement the rest of typeconv.go functionality. Both Go -> C and C -> Go.
 - Think about adding "user_data" support for closures. At the moment my (nsf)
   opinion is that they are useless, because there are real language closures.
 - Go-gobject-gen needs a way to share code between gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0.
